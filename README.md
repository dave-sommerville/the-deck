# Javascript Deck Object with SVG Deck

Extracted from my [Blackjack project](https://dave-sommerville.github.io/blackjack/), I thought that the Javascript object I wrote to go along with Tek Eye's svgs could offer value for others. By assigning values to the card names and image sources, I have simplifed the process of differentiating face cards in most games. If you have any suggestions or comments, please reach out to me at dave.r.sommerville@outlook.com
